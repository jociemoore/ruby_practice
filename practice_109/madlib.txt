I just finished Roosevelt's Cooking School of ADJECTIVE PLURAL. The last day of classes, I wow-ed my teacher with a ADJECTIVE NOUN from California. I prepared it ADVERB because it was baked ADVERB with 5 PLURAL. The instant my teacher tried it, he exclaimed, 'VERB NOUN'. That's when I knew I would have a ADJECTIVE career ahead of me!
