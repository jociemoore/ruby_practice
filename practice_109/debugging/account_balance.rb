# This program does not reflect the expected result of about $238 because on line 32, balance is reassigned to a new value representing the balance of that iteration. When the program finishes, the last calculated balance is for March and that is the amount outputted on line 35. To fix this bug, change line 32: balance += calculate_balance(month).
