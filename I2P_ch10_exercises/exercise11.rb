# I checked out three Ruby API sources: a.) ruby-doc.org, b.) docs.ruby-lang.org, and c.) www.rubydoc.info. 

# I have come to appreciate the list of class-related methods placed in the aside on the left; this section significantly helps with quick navigation. The third API does not have this feature, which immediately made it a less favorable resource in my mind. (Note: www.rubydoc.info does have a list of all methods, which you can select in order to view.) 

# The first and second resources are very similar. I like the conversational tone and simple examples of both, however, I find the visual hierarchy of docs.ruby-lang.org a little easier on the eyes. I hope this quality will allow me to find what I am looking for more quickly in the future.
